# AgriData Explorer 🌾  
**Understanding Indian Agriculture Through Data Visualization & Analytics**

---

## 📘 Project Overview
AgriData Explorer is an end-to-end **data analytics and visualization project** aimed at exploring **Indian agricultural data** across states and districts. The platform integrates multiple datasets to deliver insights into **crop production, yield, and cultivated area** through **Power BI dashboards, Python analytics, and SQL queries**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
India’s agricultural data is highly **fragmented, complex, and difficult to analyze**, making it challenging for **farmers, policymakers, and researchers** to make informed decisions.  
AgriData Explorer addresses this problem by integrating multiple datasets, performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and building **interactive dashboards** for better decision-making.

---

## 🚜 Goals
- Analyze district-level crop data for **production trends and yield efficiency**.  
- Build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for agricultural metrics.  
- Use **SQL and Python** for data cleaning, transformation, and query-based exploration.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for crop selection and agricultural improvements.

## 📂 Data Sources
**Dataset:** [ICRISAT – District Level Agricultural Data]  
Covers crop, district, and state-level statistics.  

**Fields include:**
- Crop name (rice, wheat, maize, oilseeds, etc.)  
- Area cultivated (1000 ha)  
- Production (1000 tons)  
- Yield (kg/ha)  
- Year, District, State identifiers

## 🧩 Project Architecture
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
   - Gather data from government & institutional sources.  
   - Handle missing values, standardize units, and ensure consistency.  

2. **Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identify correlations between crop area and yield.  
   - Determine top-performing crops per region.  
   - Detect yield trends over years.  

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Create interactive plots using **Plotly & Power BI**.  
   - Visualize with **heatmaps, bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots**.  

4. **Database Design:**  
   - Use **SQL schema** to normalize and store structured data.  

5. **Power BI Dashboard:**  
   - Use **Get Data → Transform → Model → Visualize workflow**.  
   - Add slicers for **State, Crop Type, and Year**.  
   - Build visual elements:  
     - **Geographical heatmaps** (crop yield by state)  
     - **Time-series line charts** (production over decades)  
     - **Bar charts** (top producing states)  
     - **KPIs** for area, yield, and production totals.
